- Toggle the visibility of inline hints, rather than remove them, when inline hints are toggled

	Inline hints are currently rendered as block decorations in atom. However, toggling the visibility of a block decoration (via css class toggle) does not trigger a reflow in atom, causing odd empty spaces until another reflow event occurrs.
	Ideally I'd like to hide them, while still maintaining their associative position in the source (so if code above them is inserted/deleted I'd like them to move with the sourceline they're associated with, not snap back to an old position upon toggle)

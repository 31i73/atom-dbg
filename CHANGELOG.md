* Improved: Now uses Atom 1.17 docks. Sidebars can now be resized, split, dragged or tabbed anywhere within Atom, and by default are docked onto the side of the screen
* Fixed: Incompatibilities with some themes/font-sizings ([#17 - cocoaway](https://github.com/31i73/atom-dbg/issues/17))
* Fixed: Error when trying to toggle breakpoint if a texteditor is not focused ([#15 - rohmer](https://github.com/31i73/atom-dbg/issues/15))

* Added: Debug configuration files. You can now save named debug configs, with custom options in project config files ([vanossj](https://github.com/vanossj))
	*  Added: You can now save configs from the debug configuration panel
* Changed: Pressing `F5` (dbg:pause-continue) to begin a new debug session now either prompts to select a debug config if configs are available, or shows the configuration panel
* Fixed: Depreciated shadowdom removed. Now Atom 1.13+ only  ([vanossj](https://github.com/vanossj))
* Changed: File paths are now relative, not absolute (in the case of debug config files, saved paths are relative to the location of this file)
* Improved: Debug configuration panel debugger dropdown now shows "descriptive" names, rather than debug identifiers
* #### 1.4.1
	* Fixed: Debugger selector on the custom panel did not function, and when saved would store incorrect debugger names

	* Fixed: Scrolling would also scroll the header out of view
	* Changed: Ratio is now fixed at 2:1 for variables:stack-trace
* Fixed: The "step-out" button was still enabled when at the top of the stack and would cause debugger errors if clicked
* #### 1.3.1
	* Fixed: Sidebar font sizes were too small with certain themes, and colours not always readable ([#6 - dcarrera](https://github.com/31i73/atom-dbg/issues/6))

	* Right-clicking a file from the treeview and selecting **Debug** will now open the config panel, with that path and working directory selected

* Added: A toggle button for showing variable types
* Added: You can now click in the gutter to toggle breakpoints in sourcefiles
